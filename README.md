This is a simple Python project that I am working on in order to practice some of my matrix manipulation skills.  I was asked in an interview how to preform the swipe left function and I fumbled a bit during my answer, so I thought that building the rest of the game would be a fun challenge.

# Run Instructions
1. You need python to run this project, so if you don't have it install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
3. Run the command 'python3 main.py'
